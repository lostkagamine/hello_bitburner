# Hello, Bitburner!
A [haxeburner](https://github.com/ry00001/haxeburner) example.

Feel free to base your own scripts off of this.

## How do I compile it?
Download haxeburner and register it using `haxelib dev`.
Afterwards, run `npm i` then [`just`](https://just.systems).
Then, you will find the output in bin/x3.js.
This is not really practical to use because the output files take up **a lot** of RAM, but I hope it's interesting.
